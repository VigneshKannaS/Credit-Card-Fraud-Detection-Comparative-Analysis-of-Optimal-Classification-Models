# CreditCard-Fraud-Detection-Model

CreditCard-Fraud-Detection model applies the logistic regression algorithm to predict the likelihood of a credit card transaction being fraudulent based on various features associated with transaction.This model will predict, whether the particular transaction is legitimate or fraudulent. The Predicted Outcomes will be displayed to the users through webapp developed in the Streamlit framework

# Dataset

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.

This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

# motto

To detect credit card fraud transactions with their necessary features by employing machine learning technology. 

Credit card usage has increased dramatically worldwide. People now prefer going cashless and rely heavily on online transactions. Criminals cause a significant amount of financial loss each year. According to the PWC Global Economy Crime Survey of 2017, approximately 48% of organizations experienced economic crime. Therefore, there is a pressing need to address the issue of credit card fraud detection.
