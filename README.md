# CreditCard-Fraud-Detection-Model

CreditCard-Fraud-Detection model applies the logistic regression algorithm to predict the likelihood of a credit card transaction being fraudulent based on various features associated with transaction.

# Dataset

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.

This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

# motto

To Detect the CreditCard fraud detection transaction with it's necessary features by employing MachineLearning technology.
